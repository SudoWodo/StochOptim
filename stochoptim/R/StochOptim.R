#' @title  A Unified Interface to Multiple Stochastic Optimization Tools
#'
#' @description StochOptim project attempts to provide a common calling structure
#' for a number of stochastic optimization tools already available for R.
#'
#' @section problem-statement:
#'
#' R has a number of tools for what is termed optimization. This is the process
#' of finding the minimum (or maximum) of a function of a vector parameters, b,
#' and exogenous data, Y, by varying the values of the elements of b to attain
#' the least (or greatest) value of the function.
#'
#' Many programmers have contributed over better than half a century to the
#' development of optimization tools. This has led to a wide variety of ways in
#' which the tools are invoked. In R, a wide variety of calling sequences exist
#' for the different methods. This is burdensome for users. If they have
#' prepared a function to minimize, they must learn and code a different call
#' for each method.
