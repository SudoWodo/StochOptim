<h1>StochOpt - an R wrapper for stochastic and global optimization tools</h1>

 
<h2>Background</h2>

<p>R has a number of tools for what is termed <b>optimization</b>.
This is the process of finding the minimum (or maximum) of a function
of a vector parameters, b, and exogenous data, Y, by varying the 
values of the elements of b to attain the least (or greatest) value
of the function. There may be other conditions, or <b>constraints</b>
imposed. Note that we can maximize a function by minimizing (-1) times
that function, and we will generally <b>minimize</b>.</p>

<p>Many of the R optimization tools, either in the base distribution or in 
<b>packages</b>, particularly those in the official CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org)
or other collections, are for functions that have just one optimum in a region. 
Other tools try to find the best of several <b>multiple minima</b> or the <b>global
minimum</b>. Most of these tools use stochastic methods.
</p>

<p>Many programmers have contributed over better than half a century to the development
of optimization tools. This has led to a wide variety of ways in which the tools are
invoked. In R, a wide variety of <b>calling sequences</b> exist for the different 
methods. This is burdensome for users. If they have prepared a function to minimize,
they must learn and code a different call for each method.</p>

<p>To ease this burden, wrapper programs can be prepared that are invoked by a 
standard syntax within which a single argument (possibly augmented by some control
parameters) selects one of a set of optimization solvers. This is the case for
the package <b>optimx</b> (??ref??) for a number of optimization solvers that deal
with finding a local minimum, possibly subject to lower and upper bounds on the 
objective function parameters. Moreover, there is the facility to use the "opm()"
function to try several solvers in a single call and generate a comparison table
of results.</p>

<p>For stochastic/global optimization solvers, there is no such wrapper as yet. The
creation of such a wrapper is the goal of this proposal.</p>

<h2>Related work</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/optimx/index.html"><b>optimx</b></a>
package gives an example that is closest to the goal of the current proposal.</p>



<p>There is also the <b>R Optimization Infrastructure</b> (ROI), but this uses a rather different
approach and is less a wrapper than a set of interfaces.</p>

<h2>Details of your coding project</h2>

<p>This project will attempt to provide a common calling structure for a number of stochastic
optimization tools already available for R.</p>

<p>We believe that the output of this project would be an R package similar in 
structure to <b>optimx</b>. That is, besides obeying R general package requirements,
it should have tools to</p> 

<ul>

<li>execute one of a set of stochastic optimizers using a standard syntax, given an appropriate
character string "method" that specifies the particular solver</li>

<li>execute a set of methods in a vector of character strings in "method" and return a data frame
with the results.</li>
</ul>

What exactly do you want your student to code in the 3-month deadline? What functions? What do they do? Docs? Tests? Vignettes?


<h2>Expected impact</h2>

<b>optimx</b> has proved helpful in allowing developers of other packages to offer
multiple solvers with their programs with minimal extra effort. We believe a wrapper
for stochastic optimizers will be at least as helpful. 

It is also likely that a wrapper will permit better comparison and benchmarking of
stochastic optimization tools in R.

No tool of this type exists at the moment to our knowledge.

<h2>Tests</h2>

Students, please contact mentors after completing at least some of the tests below.

All tests should be answered in an Rmarkdown file (part of the test is to see that
you can do this). All program code should be in R.

<h3>1.Rosenbrock function</h3> 
<p>Prepare R code for the traditional Rosenbrock function of a vector b = (x, x)</p>

<p>Rated: Easy</p>

<h3>2. optim()</h3> <p>Try to minimize this with the base R <b>optim()</b> function. Be sure to document
what you do.</p>

<p>Rated: Easy</p>

<h3>3.Extended Rosenbrock</h3> <p>Code an n-dimensional extension of the Rosenbrock function (reference the literature
for your choice).</p>

<p>Rated: Easy</p>

<h3>4.Solve Rosenbrock</h3> <p>Try to minimize this extended Rosenbrock function in 4 and 40 dimensions with at
least 3 solvers from the <b>optimx</b> package. Note that you should be able to run all of 
these with one call in R.</p>

<p>Rated: Easy</p>

<h3>5. Volcano function</h3> <p>Prepare R code for the <b>volcano</b> function of two parameters b=c(x,y) that is defined as</p>  
       
<p>       f(d) = (10 - 0.5*d) + sin(2*d) where d is the square norm distance from x=1, y=5.</p> 

<p>What are the likely issues in minimizing this function over the two dimensions. A [3D] perspective
plot may help you.</p>

<p>Rated: Moderate</p>

<h3>6. Rastrigin function</h3> <p>Code the Rastrigin function in two dimensions.</p> 

<p>Rated: Moderate</p>

<h3>7. Stochastic optimization of Rastrigin function</h3> <p>Try minimizing the Rastrigin function using three (preferably very different) stochastic
optimization tools from CRAN.</p>

<p>Rated: Moderate</p>
